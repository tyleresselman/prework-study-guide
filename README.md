# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this webpage using the prework tools provided through my bootcamp. My goal throughout the process was to follow the instructions I was given as closely as possible. The hope was to challenge myself by sharpening my focus and reading deeply from the resources provided to me. I built this particular webpage because it embodies the foundational skills I need to be successful in my journey toward becoming a web developer.

I learned a great deal from the experience of building this webpage. Beyond learning tons of new syntax across the board, I also gained a much clearer idea of what it is like to work in this arena on a day-to-day basis. The attention to detail and clarity that are required are formidable. But it is a worthy task to be able to apply those principles to this boot camp experience as well.

## Usage

This site is best used as an illustration of the basic skills of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. It features a section for each of those topics with assorted notes on their usage that I took throughout the process of building the site.

You may open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. We'll see the Javascript running with a list of the topics we discuss in this process and a randomly selected topic as a suggestion of what to study.
